# Qraft

## Installation
Uhh btw you can't actually run the files because I never figured out how to handle dependencies (my aquaternion and Spacemath modules are required for some scripts to work)

Clone this repository and run the following command:
```
python setup.py install
```

## How to use

Grab some fresh boilerplate code from scenes/boilerplate.py, and work from there.
